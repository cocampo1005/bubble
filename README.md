## Reflection

This project was a great opportunity to explore working with SaaS applications and creating a full stack application from scratch. 

I learned about many new libraries and just the breathe of what you can accomplish with all the tools React and the other technologies provide. 

Down the road, I intend on further polishing this site, adding new features such as profile editing, comments for models, likes, follwers, and much more.
